Optimization models for without vs with interface activity tests

i.e. 

SingleDomainOptimizationModel_E: 
Only single domain electricity devices are active. CHP, HP, P2G schedules are not operating. 

SingleDomainOptimizationModel_G: 
Only single domain gas (heating) devices are active. CHP, P2G schedules are not operating. 

SingleDomainOptimizationModel_W
Only single domain water devices are active. HEs are not operating.

OptimizationModel_EGTW
Interface devices e.g. CHP, HP, HE, P2G are active.
