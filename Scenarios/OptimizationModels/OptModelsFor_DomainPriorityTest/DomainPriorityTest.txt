Two-step vs One-step Cross-Domain Optimization

i.e.

OptimizationModel_EGTW (One-Step Cross-Domain Optimization)
Domains are optimizied simultaneously

OptimizationModel_EG (Electricity Prior Two-Step Cross-Domain Optimization)
Electricity domain is optimized first
Schedules of ele-gas interface devices will be chosen acc. to electricity domain targets

OptimizationModel_GE (Gas Prior Two-step Cross-Domain Optimization)
Electricity domain is optimized first
Schedules of ele-gas interface devices will be chosen acc. to electricity domain targets
